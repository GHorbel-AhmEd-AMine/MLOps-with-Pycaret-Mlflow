# MLOps-with-Pycaret-Mlflow
Integrating MLOps in our machine learning experiments using PyCaret and MLflow 


## PyCaret
 
1) PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library and end-to-end model management tool built-in Python for automating machine learning workflows. It is known for its ease of use, simplicity, and ability to quickly and efficiently build and deploy end-to-end ML prototypes.

2) PyCaret is an alternate low-code library that can replace hundreds of code lines with few lines only. This makes the experiment cycle exponentially fast and efficient.
